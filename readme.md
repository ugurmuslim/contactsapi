## Web Service Lumen For Google Contact CSV download

# How To Run

After cloning the repo all you have to do is;

```bash
php -S localhost:8000 public/index.php
```

Then you can call this endpoint from your browser

```bash
http://localhost:8000/authentication/google
```

Right now there is only google but if wanted other services can be added.
